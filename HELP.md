File Friendly is designed to help you organize and file your Outlook
emails with speed and accuracy. This help file provides guidance on
using the program's features and maximizing your productivity.

# Primary Windows

The program has two primary windows: a Pick-a-Folder and Main window.
Both appear when File Friendly starts. They can be docked together or
undocked and used independently. Filtering is easy---start typing a
folder name in either window to quickly filter the list.

# Sorting & Email Chains

Click a column header (e.g., Date or Subject) to sort emails. Sorting by
subject groups related emails into chains---even if the subject lines
are identical.

# Selecting Emails

Click to select one email, double-click to select an entire chain, or
use Shift/Ctrl for multiple selections.

# Options

Access options via Actions → Options. Configure folders to scan/show,
enable automatic chain selection, and upgrade notifications.

# Filing & Managing Emails

File emails by double-clicking a folder or using right-click menus.
Recommendations suggest folders based on previous filing habits.

# Quick Filter

Type part of a folder name to filter the list; use the Quick Filter bar
or the Escape key to reset.

# Other Actions

Open, delete, hide, or undo actions using right-click menus or keyboard
shortcuts.

# View Options

Filter emails by Inbox, Sent, Filed, Read, or Unread using the View
menu.

# Additional Notes

Deleted emails move to Outlook's Deleted Items folder. Unread emails
appear bolded; read emails do not.

# License & Support

File Friendly is open source, distributed under the MIT License, and
free to use.
