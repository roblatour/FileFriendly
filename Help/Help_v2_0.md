# File Friendly v2.0 - Help

File Friendly is designed to help you organize and file your Outlook
e-mails with speed and accuracy. This help file provides guidance on
using the program's features and maximizing your productivity.

# Primary Windows

The program has two primary windows: a Main window and a Pick-A-Folder window.
Both appear when File Friendly starts. They can be docked together or
undocked and used independently. Filtering is easy, just start typing a
folder name in either window to quickly filter the folders in  the Pick-A-Folder list.

# Sorting & Email Chains

Click a column header (e.g., Date or Subject) to sort e-mails. Sorting by
subject groups related e-mails into chains.

# Selecting e-mails

Click to select one email, double-click to select an entire chain, or
use Shift/Ctrl for multiple selections.

# Options

Access options via Actions → Options. Configure folders to scan/show, enable automatic chain selection, and upgrade notifications.

Most options should be self explanatory.

Clicking the Start → 'Folders to scan' button allows you to tailor which mailboxes and folders you would like FileFriendly to scan.

Checking the Start → 'Scan filed e-mails' option causes FileFriendly to do a deep scan on your e-mails at start-up time.  This can be a long running process. To halt it it you can select Actions → 'Stop Refresh'.  

# Filing & Managing e-mails

File e-mails by double-clicking a folder or using right-click menus.
Recommendations suggest folders based on previous filing habits.

# Quick Filter

Type part of a folder name to filter the list; use the Quick Filter bar
or the Escape key to reset.

# Other Actions

Open, delete, hide, or undo actions using right-click menus or keyboard
shortcuts.

# View Options

Filter e-mails by Inbox, Sent, Filed, Read, or Unread using the View
menu.

# Additional Notes

If multiple Mailboxes are found when scanning your e-mails, the Main window will contain a 'Mailbox' column. However, if only one Mailbox is found, then the 'Mailbox' column will not appear.

Deleted e-mails move to the Deleted Items / Trash folder of the mailbox associated with the e-mail. 

Unread e-mails appear bolded; read e-mails do not.
