# File Friendly v2.6.1 - Help

File Friendly is designed to help you organize and file your Outlook
e-mails with speed and accuracy. This help file provides guidance on
using the program's features and maximizing your productivity.

# Primary Windows

The program has two primary windows: a Main Window and a Pick-A-Folder window.
Both appear when File Friendly starts. They can be docked together or
undocked and used independently. Filtering is easy, just start typing a
folder name in either window to quickly filter the folders in  the Pick-A-Folder list.

# Options

Access options via Actions → Change Options. Configure folders to scan/show, enable automatic chain selection, and upgrade notifications.

Most options should be self explanatory.

Clicking the Start → Change Options → 'Folders to scan' button allows you to tailor which mailboxes and folders you would like FileFriendly to scan, while clicking the Start → Change Options → 'Folders to view' button allows you to tailor which folders you can view when filing e-mails. Of note, in each case certain folders are disabled from selection, for example: the Sent and Outbox folders are disabled from selection in the 'Folders to view' window in order that e-mails are not be inadvertently filed into them.

Checking the Start → Change Options → 'Scan filed e-mails' option causes FileFriendly to do a deep scan on your e-mails at start-up time.  This can be a long running process. To halt it it you can select Actions → 'Stop Refresh'.  

# Refreshing the Main Window

The Main Window will auto refresh when changes are made in Outlook - for example if an e-mail is deleted in Outlook the corresponding e-mail should, following a brief delay of a few seconds, be automatically removed from the Main Window.

To manually refresh the Main Window, click Actions → Refresh and then when prompted select what you want to refresh.

If you only want to refresh the inbox and sent items, click Actions → Quick Refresh or press F5.

Selecting 'Other folders' will cause the program to re-inventory all your folders and then do a deep content review of all the folders which are selected for review in the Action → Options → Folders to Scan.  Depending on your system and the number of e-mails in your folders this could take a very long time (many minutes).  A progress bar will show you how quickly the process is proceeding.  If you want to stop this process, you can click on Actions → Stop Refresh.

Once the deep scan is complete, the Main Window will show you e-mails that belong to an e-mail chain where one or more are stored in differing folders - this is a great way to allow FileFriendly to help you find misfiled emails.  Please see 'Filing & Managing e-mails' below to understand how you can then file all those e-mails in a single folder.

# Sorting & Email Chains

Click a column header (e.g., Date or Subject) to sort e-mails. Sorting by subject groups related e-mails into chains.

# Selecting e-mails

Click to select one email, or use Shift/Ctrl for multiple selections.  

Also, if the option 'Select chains automatically' is checked, then if the e-mail is showing as being part of an e-mail chain on the Main Window, the then all e-mails in that chain will be selected.

# Filing & Managing e-mails

File e-mails by double-clicking a folder or using right-click menus.

Recommendations suggest folders, based on previous filing habits, will appear on the Pick-A-Folder window if you have done a scan including all folders.  Clicking on one of those recommendations a causes all associated selected e-mails to be stored in the folder being recommended.

# Hiding e-mails

When you have done a scan including other folders FileFriendly will show you all e-mails that belong to a chain that are filed in different folders.  In many cases this is a great way to find misfiled e-mails.  However, it may also be the case that you want to have some e-mails in a chain in one folder, and others in another.  In these cases you can hide the e-mails in FileFriendly's main window by selecting them and either right clicking and selecting 'Hide', or by clicking on Actions → Hide in the main menu. 

E-mails hidden in this way will be hidden in FileFriendly only (how they are shown in Outlook will not change).

Of note: there is FileFriendly start option to keep hiding previousily hidden e-mails.  With this option checked FileFriendly will keep hidden all the e-mails which you have hidden in early uses of FileFriendly.  If however, you uncheck the option FileFriendly will forget all of those hidden e-mails and show you everything once again the next time you start FileFriendly.

# Quick Filter

Start typing the folder name you want to look for and watch the magic happen; use the Quick Filter bar's 'None' option, or press the Escape key to reset.

# Other Actions

Open, toggle read/unread, delete, hide, or undo actions using right-click menus or keyboard shortcuts.

# View Options

Filter e-mails by Inbox, Sent, Filed, Read, or Unread using the View menu item.

# Additional Notes

If multiple Mailboxes are found when scanning your e-mails, the Main Window will contain a 'Mailbox' column. However, if only one Mailbox is found, then the 'Mailbox' column will not appear.

The e-mail subject displayed in the main window will have all leading 'RE:', 'FWD:', and 'FW:' (case insensitive) prefixes removed to help with sorting and review.  Original e-mails, stored in Outlook, will remained unchanged.

Deleted e-mails move to the Deleted Items / Trash folder of the mailbox associated with the e-mail. 

Unread e-mails appear bolded; read e-mails do not.
