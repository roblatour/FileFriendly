# File Friendly v2.1.3 - Help

File Friendly is designed to help you organize and file your Outlook
e-mails with speed and accuracy. This help file provides guidance on
using the program's features and maximizing your productivity.

# Primary Windows

The program has two primary windows: a Main window and a Pick-A-Folder window.
Both appear when File Friendly starts. They can be docked together or
undocked and used independently. Filtering is easy, just start typing a
folder name in either window to quickly filter the folders in  the Pick-A-Folder list.

# Refreshing the Main Window
The main window should auto refresh when changes are made in Outlook - for example if an e-mail is deleted in Outlook the corresponding e-mail should, following a brief delay of a few seconds, be automatically removed from the Main Window.

To manually refresh the main window, click Actions → Refresh and then when prompted select what you want to refresh.

Selecting the 'Inbox' and/or the 'Outbox' allows the program to immediately refresh the Main Window.  

Selecting 'Other folders' will cause the program to reinventory all your folders and then do a deep content review of all the folders which are selected for review in the Action → Options → Folders to Scan.  Depending on your system and the number of e-mails in your folders this could take a very long time (many minutes).  A progress bar will show you how quickly the process is proceeding.  If you want to stop this process, you can click on Actions → Stop Refresh.

Once the deep scan is complete, the Main Window will show you e-mails that belong to an e-mail chain where one or more are stored in differing folders - this is a great way to allow FileFriendly to help you find misfiled emails.  Please see 'Filing & Managing e-mails' below to understand how you can then file all those e-mails in a single folder.

Pressing the Function key 'F5' will do a refresh, that refresh will be based on the options you last chose when Refreshing via an Action → Refresh.

# Sorting & Email Chains

Click a column header (e.g., Date or Subject) to sort e-mails. Sorting by
subject groups related e-mails into chains.

# Selecting e-mails

Click to select one email, or use Shift/Ctrl for multiple selections.  

Also, if the option 'Select chains automatically' is checked, then if the e-mail is showing as being part of an e-mail chain on the main window, the then all e-mails in that chain will be selected.

# Options

Access options via Actions → Options. Configure folders to scan/show, enable automatic chain selection, and upgrade notifications.

Most options should be self explanatory.

Clicking the Start → Options → 'Folders to scan' button allows you to tailor which mailboxes and folders you would like FileFriendly to scan.

Checking the Start → Options → 'Scan filed e-mails' option causes FileFriendly to do a deep scan on your e-mails at start-up time.  This can be a long running process. To halt it it you can select Actions → 'Stop Refresh'.  

# Filing & Managing e-mails

File e-mails by double-clicking a folder or using right-click menus.

Recommendations suggest folders, based on previous filing habits, will appear on the Pick-A-Folder window if you have done a scan including all folders.  Clicking on one of those recommendations a causes all associated selected e-mails to be stored in the folder being recommended.

# Quick Filter

Type part of a folder name to filter the list; use the Quick Filter bar
or the Escape key to reset.

# Other Actions

Open, toggle read/unread, delete, hide, or undo actions using right-click menus or keyboard
shortcuts.

# View Options

Filter e-mails by Inbox, Sent, Filed, Read, or Unread using the View menu item.

# Additional Notes

If multiple Mailboxes are found when scanning your e-mails, the Main window will contain a 'Mailbox' column. However, if only one Mailbox is found, then the 'Mailbox' column will not appear.

Deleted e-mails move to the Deleted Items / Trash folder of the mailbox associated with the e-mail. 

Unread e-mails appear bolded; read e-mails do not.
