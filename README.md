# Overview - FileFriendly v2.1.2 (2025-12-24)

File Friendly works with Microsoft Outlook® to quickly and easily file
your e-mails exactly where you need them to be.

The program scans, organizes, and presents your Outlook e-mails for
rapid filing. Related e-mails are automatically chained together and
these, as well as individual e-mails, can then be filed in a fraction of
the time you are used to.

# Key Features

- Rapid Email Filing: File emails exactly where you need them, quickly
  and easily.

- Smart Recommendations: Suggests folders based on your previous filing
  habits.

- Chain Detection: Automatically groups related emails, even if they
  share the same subject line.

- Misfile Detection: Helps you find and correct misfiled emails by
  showing where related emails are stored in different folders or
  mailboxes.

- Consolidate Inbox/Outbox view: If you have multiple inboxes and
  outboxes the program can provide a consolidated view of them all.

- Quick Actions: Abbreviate folder choices, file multiple emails at
  once, and use keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.

- Customizable Scanning: Choose which folders to scan and display,
  excluding those you don't need (like Deleted Items or Spam).

  intuitive controls.
